To add a new language, you can add the language to this file.
Use the name of the language in that language.
Then make a copy of the English language file "lang_en.xml"
and rename it to "lang_xx_ref.xml". Then create a second
copy and rename it to "lang_xx.xml". Then translate the
latter file into the new language.

The file "lang_xx_ref.xml" is important because it helps me
to keep track of future changes to the language files.

If you also want to translate the static part of the documentation,
you have to translate the file "static_en.xml" from the
folder "src/test/Resources/Docu".

You can test the translation by simply putting the files into
the Digital.jar file. It's not necessary to rebuild the jar.

If you are satisfied with the translation, please send me the
translated version AND the file "lang_xx_ref.xml" you used for the
translation!
