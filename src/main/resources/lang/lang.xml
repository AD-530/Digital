To add a new language, you can add the language to this file.
Use the name of the language in that language.
Then copy the English language file "lang_en.xml", rename
it and translate it into the new language.

If you also want to translate the static part of the documentation,
you have to translate one of the files "static_xx.xml" from the
folder "src/test/Resources/Docu".

If you are satisfied with the translation, please send me the
translated version AND the file "lang_en.xml" you used for the
translation! Both files are required to keep track of changes.
